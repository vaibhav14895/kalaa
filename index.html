            Artwork brings harmony and connects us to the soul of society. Artworks play a critical role in building a peaceful,
            creative and harmonious society. Indian states are blessed with a rich legacy of artforms. Several artists have played
            pivotal roles in promoting these artforms.
            
            India has a rich heritage of artforms. Every artwork has its own beautiful story. These stories date back to 1000-2000
            years old. We can pass this story to our next generation by observing the work of artisans. There is a belief that
            Madhubani paintings originated from Sita's wedding. The painting uses handmade products: turmeric, banyan leaf milk,
            indigo, kusum flower, green leaf of the applewood tree etc.
            
            India has a rich diversity of artforms or artworks. Each art form reflects the ethos and thought process of society of
            that time. When we bring art product of handmade artforms, we bring great heritage and story to our house. These stories
            can pass on to our generations.
